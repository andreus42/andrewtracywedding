Our registry is all about the experience. We'll be off to adventure in Paris...a new experience for the both of us!

Concerning gifts, we're quite happy with the apartment life and need no cookware, dishes, towels, stuff, etc.
 We're definitely trying to embrace minimalism. We're not even sure what traditional registries are made of.
 Good thing we're not too traditional--except perhaps the trip to Paris.
