        <p>Born June 12, 1977 in the state of Georgia, Andrew spent most of his life
        growing up in Keene, NH. He is known for his love of disc golf, politics, and Tracy.
        Andrew is currently working on getting the website up and running,

      <h3>Andrew & Tracy</h3>
      <div class="bio-copy">
      <p>Tracy and Andy first communicated Sept 5th, 2013, and first met
        Sept 15th, 2013. Their first date is fondly referred to as "The park
        bench" as they sat and talked for hours, so delighted to be in each
        other's presence.
      </p>
      <p>Tracy & Andy were first engaged under an American Sycamore tree in Brattleboro, VT.
      They married in Keene, NH on June 6th, 2016, and are now ready to have a wedding
      ceremony.

      <p>
        Born January 30, 1985 in Oneida, NY, Tracy is excited to share with you the
        beautiful landscape she explored in childhood that you'll look upon from
        Best View Barn. When not consumed with details of wedding planning,
        Tracy is training at TFW Keene, spending time outdoors, learning to
        become a more technical Technical Analyst, and enjoying life with Andrew.

        <p>Cocktail hour appetizers and reception dinner will be Lebanese-style Mediterranean,
          provided by the friendly Zeinas family, who run a cafe in Utica, NY. When
          trying out the cafe cuisine, Andrew and Tracy found them to be a humor-filled,
          warm-natured, and sincere family.</p>
        <p>We are sure there will be something tasty for everyone!</p>
        <p>Dessert will be provided in part by Zeina’s. This is your chance to try chocolate
        humus, delicious as a dip for cut fruit (or anything really)! We’ll also have an assortment
        of fresh fruit pies, provisioned from North Star Orchards, in Westmoreland, NY.
