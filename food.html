  <p>Cocktail hour appetizers and reception dinner will be Lebanese-style Mediterranean,
    provided by the friendly Zeinas family, who run a cafe in Utica, NY. When
    trying out the cafe cuisine, Andrew and Tracy found them to be a humor-filled,
    warm-natured, and sincere family.</p>
  <p>We are sure there will be something tasty for everyone!</p>
  <p>Dessert will be provided in part by Zeina’s. This is your chance to try chocolate
  humus, delicious as a dip for cut fruit (or anything really)! We’ll also have an assortment
  of fresh fruit pies, provisioned from North Star Orchards, in Westmoreland, NY.
